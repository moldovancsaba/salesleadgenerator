# Changelog — Sales Lead Generator

## 2.2.0

Security, dependency, and code-quality remediation following a two-pass engineering audit (tracked in GitHub issues #1–#21). No breaking API/UI changes.

### Security
- Fixed an API-key authentication bypass: `requireApiKey` previously allowed any request through if the `x-api-key` header was simply omitted, even when `SLG_API_KEY` was configured — only a *wrong* key was rejected. Now a missing header is rejected identically to a wrong one.
- Added the missing `requireApiKey` check to `POST /api/outcome-logs`, which had no auth gate at all, unlike every sibling write endpoint.

### Fixed
- Fixed a build-breaking undefined `columnWidth` reference in `KanbanBoard` (`app/kanban.tsx`), derived from the existing `mode` prop.
- Fixed `PUT /api/leads/:id` silently skipping all validation that `POST` enforces — malformed URLs, out-of-range ICE scores, and forbidden cross-brand fields could previously be written on update. `validateLeadPayload` now accepts a `{ partial: true }` option for update-shaped payloads.
- Fixed `Lead.region`'s frontend type (`app/types.ts`), which listed values (`USA`, `APAC`, `LATAM`, `EUROPE`, `GLOBAL`, `AFRICA`) that don't match what the backend actually produces (`US`, `CEE`, `MENA`). Tightening the type surfaced a live bug: the lead detail modal's region-color badge compared against `'USA'` instead of `'US'`, so it always fell through to the default gray color for US-region leads — fixed in the same change.
- Fixed `search-learning`'s error responses, which exposed raw exception messages directly as the `error` field; aligned to the `{ error, details }` shape used elsewhere.
- Fixed a Next.js 15 build failure (`Type '{ params: {...} }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'`) on `app/sales/[brand]/page.tsx` by splitting it into an async Server Component (awaits `params`) and a new `sales-page-client.tsx` Client Component receiving `brand` as a plain prop — no React 19 upgrade required.

### Changed — Dependencies
- Upgraded Next.js from `14.2.18` (deprecated, 14 open CVEs including HTTP request smuggling and cache poisoning, no patch in the 14.x line) to `15.5.13`+, the minimum version resolving all listed advisories. Updated the two dynamic API route handlers using `params` for Next 15's async request API.
- Established a working ESLint configuration — `npm run lint` previously had no config or dependency at all and just launched an interactive setup wizard. Enabling it immediately surfaced a real Rules-of-Hooks violation in `LeadDetailModal` (conditional `useState`/`useEffect` calls), fixed in the same change.
- Migrated ESLint 8 (deprecated) to ESLint 9 with a flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`, bridging `eslint-config-next`'s legacy preset via `@eslint/eslintrc`'s `FlatCompat`). Also switched the `lint` script from the deprecated `next lint` wrapper to the plain `eslint .` CLI.

### Changed — Code quality / de-duplication
- Removed `app/lib/validate-lead.ts`, a byte-identical, unreferenced duplicate of the real `lib/validate-lead.ts`.
- Removed two orphaned, never-imported modules documented as integrated but actually dead: `app/lib/ai-scoring/` (also internally broken — it referenced a stale `pro_for_slg`/`con_for_slg` field that never existed) and `lib/lead-validator.ts` (disagreed with the real, live validator on several rules).
- Consolidated `buildFingerprint()` (dedup hash), `deriveKanbanColumn()` (ICE→column mapping, plus removed a dead branch that could never execute), `isMongoConfigured()` (previously duplicated in 4 files with drift — the duplicates checked two env vars, `MONGODB_URI_LEADS`/`MONGODB_URI_CLASSCOUT`, that the real connection never reads, risking a false-positive "configured" check), and the pipeline-weight forecast math (previously triplicated across `stats`, `boards/[brand]`, and `forecast/export` routes) into shared modules: `lib/fingerprint.ts`, `lib/kanban-column.ts`, `lib/pipeline-weights.ts`, `lib/tenant.ts`.
- Fixed a filter bug in `/api/health`'s opt-in `tenantLeadCounts`: it used a raw exact-match `{ tenantId }` filter instead of the `tenantFilter()` pattern (matching both `'default'` and documents with no `tenantId` field) used everywhere else, undercounting when a caller explicitly requested `?tenantId=default`.

### Documentation
- Added `CLAUDE.md`, recording mandatory operating rules for any Claude session working in this repo (zero-tolerance quality gate, work-from-issues, documentation-mandatory, DoD, verify-don't-guess, and branch/push authorization for `dev`/`preview`/`main`).
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/STACK_AND_DEPENDENCIES.md`, `docs/OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`, `PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `roadmap.md`, `PROPOSAL.md`, and `deployment.md` to reflect the above and correct several pre-existing documentation/reality drifts found along the way (stale package references, a corrupted architecture diagram, broken cross-links to non-existent files, and a security description matching the pre-fix auth-bypass behavior).

### Known issues carried forward (tracked, not fixed — need owner/data input, not guessable)
- `outcomeLogs` vs `outcomelogs`: the dedicated `/api/outcome-logs` endpoint reads/writes a different-cased MongoDB collection than every other outcome-logging call site. Needs a direct database check before merging a fix, in case production data already exists in the wrong collection (tracked in issue #11).
- Three Mongoose models (`models/Lead.ts`, `OutcomeLog.ts`, `SearchLearning.ts`) are unused (the app exclusively uses the raw `mongodb` driver) and have schemas drifted from reality. Needs an owner decision: delete, or repair as a future migration path (issue #20).
- Three lead-listing endpoints (`/api/leads`, `/api/search`, `/api/leads/columns`) use three incompatible pagination shapes, one with a misleadingly-named `total` field. Unifying this is an API-contract change requiring a coordinated frontend update, not a drive-by fix (issue #21).

## 2.1.0

Current production version. Baseline for this documentation set.

### Added
- Brand-parameterized API: `/api/leads?brand=cogmap|seyu`
- Single frontend pipeline page: `/sales/[brand]`
- Mobile-first kanban board with responsive vertical stack on narrow screens
- Pointer-based drag-and-drop with ghost preview, pointer-capture cleanup, and opacity cleanup
- Collapsible kanban columns with per-column expand/collapse controls
- Live kanban column lead counts in headers, e.g. `Discovered (258)`
- Country-based filter UI derived from lead data
- ICE/name sort controls with asc/desc for kanban and table view
- Table view simplified to Name, Score, Status for mobile readability
- Table view contrast fix: dark text on light background
- Detail modal full-screen behavior on mobile via `matchMedia`
- Header/filter wrapping for narrow viewports
- PWA manifest alignment with app start URL and scope
- Mobile/PWA layout fixes: `minHeight: 100dvh`, `overflow: auto`, wrapped controls
- Action feedback toasts for mutations in lead detail modal
- Shared retry utility for transient API failures
- Validation smoke tests via `npm run test:smoke`

### Changed
- Tenant filter defaults to `default` and includes legacy docs without `tenantId`
- Lead contacts are canonical; top-level contact fields are merged into `contacts[]` on write, then cleared from list/detail responses where possible
- Drag affordance enlarged; whole card participates in pointer drag flow
- Card selection state is cleaned up after drag end/cancel
- Won/Lost column headers use green/red header treatment

### Known Issues
- Full `next build` may OOM in limited local environments; use `tsc --noEmit` for type verification
- PWA pinch-zoom behavior is tightened but may still need further refinement
- Table view mobile density/readability may still need additional tuning
- Country filter population depends on lead `country` data; sample data may be missing populated values
- Test coverage is limited to validation smoke tests; API route tests remain TODO

## Unreleased

Future work is tracked in `roadmap.md` and `PROPOSAL.md`.
